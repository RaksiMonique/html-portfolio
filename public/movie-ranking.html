<h1>The Best Movies According to Roxy</h1>

<h2>My Top Movies of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Harry Potter</h3>

<p>Specifically Prisoner of Azkaban and the Sorceror's Stone because they have a strong family element. 
    Also they are funny and before it gets too dark</p>

<h3>The Hobbit</h3>

<p>I barely get to watch the 3rd one because I didn't buy it bu the first two are nice.
    I'm beginning to think I just love movies with food lol.
</p>

<h3>Uptown Girls</h3>

<p>I just love Dakota Fanning TBH. And it's my favourite movie of hers because it's girlie.</p>

<h3>Parent Trap</h3>

<p>Love the idea of camping as a child and being a twin and living in London or on a big farm. <br/>
    Yh, it just had a lot of things I love, lol.
</p>

<h3>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory</h3>

<p>Loved the songs and the closeness of the family. 
    I also liked that Jhonny Depp stared in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
</p>

<h3>Shrek</h3>

<p>Loved the songs. Know most of the lines by heart. It's a good laugh</p>

<h3>Mary Poppins</h3>

<p>Love Julias Roberts, so I also love the Sound of Music.</p>

<h3>Rescurers Down Under</h3>

<p>I loved how they helped Charlie in the middle of nowhere.</p>
